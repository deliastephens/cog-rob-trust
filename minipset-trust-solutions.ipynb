We associate each trust level with numerical values $T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0.3 & 0.6 & 1.0 \\end{bmatrix}$, which we will use to help us model the rest of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our **action space**, $A$, is simple--the robot may choose between its own _optimal plan_ or the human's fully explainable (or _expected_ plan). (Therefore, $\\|A \\| = 2$, and $A(0) = \\pi^\\textrm{opt}$ and $A(1) = \\pi^\\textrm{exp}$). \n",

Therefore, `P[k][i][j]` represents the likelihood of transitioning from state $s_i$ to state $s_j$ with the action $a_k$. There are two cases to think about when defining our transition matrix:\n",

    "   - We model the likelihood that the trust level **stays the same** as $P(s_i, a^\\pi, s_{i}) = \\omega(i)* \\mathcal{P}(E(\\pi))$. (when our plan is fully explainable, we would expect the trust level to stay the same.)\n",
    "   - We model the likelihood that the trust level **increases** as $P(s_i, a^\\pi, s_{i+1}) = (1 - \\omega(i))$\n",

    "\n",

    "The **cost**, $C$, is modeled as a `numpy array` of size `(4, 2)`. $C(s_i, a^\\pi) = (1 - \\omega(i)) * C_e(\\pi)$, where $C_e(\\pi)$ is the cost of the fully explainable plan. Here, we'll assume that each action has unit cost, but this cost function could certainly get more complicated!\n",
