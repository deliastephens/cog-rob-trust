    "\n",
    "As described in the [Python MDP Toolbox documentation](https://pymdptoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/mdp.html), our transition matrix $P$ should be a [numpy array](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html) of size `(2, 4, 4)`. Therefore, `P[k][i][j]` represents the likelihood of transitioning from state $s_i$ to state $s_j$ with the action $a_k$. There are two cases to think about when defining our transition matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **optimal plan**. Here, we need to consider three subcases, as our robot is following a plan with a non-perfect explicability score. The trust level may either **decrease**, **stay the same**, or **increase**. \n",
    "   - We model the likelihood that the trust level **decreases** as $P(s_i, a^\\pi, s_{i-1}) = \\omega(i) * (1 - E(\\pi))$. \n",
    "   - We model the likelihood that the trust level **stays the same** as $P(s_i, a^\\pi, s_{i}) = \\omega(i) * E(\\pi)$.\n",
    "   - We model the likelihood that the trust level **increases** as $P(s_i, a^\\pi, s_{i+1}) = (1 - \\omega(i))$\n",
    "2.  The **expected plan**. Here, trust increases to the next level in all but the maximum trust level (where it is expected to remain the same).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `P(0)` corresponds with the transition matrix of the optimal plan, and `P(1)` corresponds with the transition matrix of the expected plan.\n",
    "\n",

    "The **cost**, $C$, is modeled as a `numpy array` of size `(4, 2)`. $C(s_i, a^\\pi) = (1 - \\omega(i)) * C_e(\\pi)$, where $C_e(\\pi)$ is the cost of the fully explainable plan. Here, we'll assume that each action has unit cost, but this cost function could certainly get more complicated!\n",
